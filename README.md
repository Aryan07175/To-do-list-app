✅ Add new tasks with the input field and "Add" button (or press Enter)
✅ Edit tasks by clicking the edit icon
✅ Mark tasks as complete/incomplete with the checkbox
✅ Delete tasks with the trash icon
✅ Data persistence using React state (localStorage alternative for this environment)

Additional Features:

📊 Progress tracking with a visual progress bar
🔍 Filter tasks by All, Pending, or Completed
📅 Shows creation date for each task
📈 Task counters for each filter category
🎨 Modern, responsive design with smooth animations
✨ Hover effects and visual feedback

How to Use:

Type a task in the input field and click "Add" or press Enter
Click the circle to mark tasks complete/incomplete
Click the edit icon to modify task text
Click the trash icon to delete tasks
Use the filter buttons to view different categories

The app starts with a few sample tasks so you can see it in action. In a real environment, you could easily modify this to use localStorage by replacing the React state management with localStorage operations.
Would you like me to modify anything about the design or functionality?RetryAwhat are technology it usesEditThe to-do list app uses the following technologies:
Frontend Framework:

React - JavaScript library for building user interfaces
React Hooks - useState and useEffect for state management and side effects

Styling:

Tailwind CSS - Utility-first CSS framework for styling and responsive design
CSS Gradients - For the background gradient effect
CSS Transitions - For smooth animations and hover effects

Icons:

Lucide React - Icon library providing the UI icons (Plus, Edit2, Trash2, Check, X, Calendar)

JavaScript Features:

ES6+ JavaScript - Modern JavaScript syntax including:

Arrow functions
Template literals
Destructuring
Array methods (map, filter)
Spread operator



Data Management:

React State - Using useState for storing tasks in memory
Local state management - No external state management libraries

Browser APIs (mentioned but not used in this version):

localStorage - Would be used for data persistence in a real environment

Development Approach:

Functional Components - Modern React pattern using hooks instead of class components
Component-based architecture - Single reusable component structure
Event-driven programming - Handling user interactions through event handlers

This is a modern, lightweight tech stack that's perfect for a task management application. The combination of React + Tailwind CSS provides a great developer experience with fast development and excellent performance.RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.
